# dotfiles
This project is for storing dotfiles for use with [Spin](https://development.shopify.io/engineering/keytech/spin). See [here](https://github.com/Shopify/dotfiles-starter-template) for a sample template, or check out branches on this repository for other users' dotfiles.

## How to add your dotfiles
Your dotfiles should be placed in this repository on a `branch` named after your github username. For more information on dotfiles in spin, please read [Personalizing your Environment](https://development.shopify.io/engineering/keytech/spin/isospin/tools#Personalizing_your_environment).

## Why?
Originally Spin only supported dotfiles stored in public github repositories e.g. `github.com/pam/dotfiles`, however, this was flagged by security as it exposed potentially sensitive or private data to the public internet. This repo was created as an alternative.
